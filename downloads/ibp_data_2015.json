While Hearing with Public (RDPU) is a hearing specifically for certain part of the public, and may involve part of executive branch. Both of this hearings may be closed or open to the public. \n\nTherefore, since hearings are always divided and no public testimony is every allowed during hearings with executive, we concluded that the appropriate answer is \"B\". The majority of the meetings have reports that it was held public. See: Public meetings on budgets between executive and legislative is stipulated in this law:\nLaw no. 27 Year 2009 regarding MPR (People's Assembly), DPR (House of Representatives), DPD (Regional Representatives), and DPRD (House of Regional Representatives), article no. 157 verse (3).\nhttp://dpr.go.id/id/undang-undang/2009/27/uu/Majelis-Permusyawaratan-Rakyat,-Dewan-Perwakilan-Rakyat,-Dewan-Perwakilan-Daerah,-Dan-Dewan-Perwakilan-Rakyat-Daerah\n\nShort reports of these meetings can be seen in each of the commission's portal in:\nhttp://www.dpr.go.id/", "letter": "b"}, "128": {"score": "33.0", "comments": "The legislator always separate hearings between executive and the public.

After a legislator watch in 2013 for 2014 budget, we found that the number of NGO speaks in with legislator is less than it was during the previous budget. Therefore, we concluded that public hearings which testimony from the public is heard are only held on small number of budget. \n\nLegislative held public hearings on budget as stipulated in these two laws:\n(1) Law No.17 Year 2003 regarding \"Keuangan Negara\" (State Financial), article no. 13 verse (1)\nhttp://www.sjdih.depkeu.go.id/fullText/2003/17TAHUN2003UU.htm\n(2) Law no. 27 Year 2009 regarding MPR (People's Assembly), DPR (House of Representatives), DPD (Regional Representatives), and DPRD (House of Regional Representatives), article no. 158\nhttp://dpr.go.id/id/undang-undang/2009/27/uu/Majelis-Permusyawaratan-Rakyat,-Dewan-Perwakilan-Rakyat,-Dewan-Perwakilan-Daerah,-Dan-Dewan-Perwakilan-Rakyat-Daerah", "letter": "c"}, "129": {"score": "33.0", "comments": "Reports are always made after open hearings in the legislative.

Public engagement may be more effective in the form of some of Treasury's other outreach efforts such as \"Schools/University Challenges\", which offer substantial prizes (university scholarships), but are more oriented toward encouraging public awareness/interest (among youth) rather than direct public input into policy formulation. The scope of participation or Treasury's incorporation of public views from the (quite extensive) seminar series to support public consultation during preparation of the 2014 Investment Statement is not clear. \n\nThe IRD mechanism (i.e. website access and option to subscribe to notifications of specific tax policies under review and open for public submissions, is certainly supportive of a more direct and extensive public engagement in policy formulation. However, it is also trues that the content of relevant/supporting documentation provided with respect to IRD tax policy matters (as well as some Treasury policy matters) ca be  considered relatively \"inaccessible\" to non-specialists. \n\nAs concerns the \"green paper\" / \"white paper\" process, there is clear evidence supporting, in some specific instances, a strong level of \"public engagement\", primarily in the form of submissions from specific interest/stakeholder groups for a specific issue.In the example of this process raised in Q.120 (Children's Action Plan), the substantial response from \"the public\" over the course of the policy development period does appear to have had some impact on the final \"design\" of approved policy, even if not all advice received from public submissions was accepted by the executive. \n\nIndividual departments/ministries make broad use of consultations on policies under development and on annual or muti-year work plans covering specific program areas. In many instances, consultative processes include mechanism for online submissions (with the policy documents or workplans themselves also being available online). Client and stakeholder surveys of specific services will also be used to shape policy development/reform. \n\nAt the more localized level, public engagement among regional DHBs include opportunities for public comment/submissions on program-specific work plans  (including online access) and opportunities for participation at regular DHB meetings, including public comments. See: Refer to the sources/evidence cited for the preceding question (Q.120). In particular, focusing on the clearest direct engagement between \"the executive\" and \"the public\" in the phase of \"budget\" (or policy) formulation, attention is directed to:\n\n- Treasury engagement on broad budget policy, on selected policy issues (e.g. Investment Statement and Long-Term Fiscal Model and Strategy Paper) and the Schools/University \"challenges\" \n- Issuance of \"green\" and \"white\" papers in policy formulation\n- Invitations for public submissions on proposed tax policy changes\n- Departmental/ministerial engagement with the public on policy development/work programmes\n- Decentralized executive units (e.g. DHBs) consultative processes (submissions on policy documents and regular public meetings with opportunities for input)\n\nThe chosen response of \"b\" reflects an overall assessment of both (i) the quality and timeliness of information provided to the public; (ii) the actual extent of public engagement realised through established mechanisms, including degree of responsiveness by the executive; and (iii) the scope of mechanisms for public engagement during the budget/policy formulation phase.", "letter": "b"}, "131": {"score": "67.0", "comments": "While there are no specific legal requirements for the Office of Auditor-General to engage the public at large as participants (i.e. respondents or witnesses) in their audit processes, the OAG does maintain a website through which members of the public can submit views or information they believe to be pertinent to specific audits.

The overall picture is somewhat mixed. For example, the previously cited documentation/evidence (even after excluding legislative processes/hearings) does demonstrate specific activities/evidence of direct public engagement by Treasury, Inland Revenue and other central government agencies as part of their respective processes for policy formulation and/or implementation. The assessor has not located any legal requirements for Treasury to engage in public consultation on a specific routine basis, so the evidence of such practices appears to be evidence of \"informal\" procedures deemed to be \"good practice\" but not legally required, Similarly, in the case of other executive agencies, the scope of public engagement (e.g. MSD client surveys) appear to be on the basis of what is deemed \"good practice\" rather than compliance with an established legal requirement. In other cases such as Transit New Zealand and (it would appear) Inland Revenue, there does appear to be some legal/regulatory requirement for a public consultative process to be implemented in the course of policy formulation (e.g. a process for public submissions on proposed tax policy changes) or policy implementation (e.g. consultative process with affected public required of Transit NZ under Land Transport Management Act). \n\nIn sum, there are legally mandated public consultative processes for selected elements of policy formulation and implementation and other consultative processes conducted on the basis of what executive agencies deem to be \"good practice\". The scope of these activities includes both policy formulation and policy implementation, but the formal legal framework is not comprehensive, particularly with regard to budget policies under direct management of Treasury as the central finance agency.\n\nOn the basis of this summary assessment, the most appropriate (if somewhat conservative) response is deemed to be a \"c\".\n\n\nOriginal Comment:\nIt is challenging to accurately align the assessed scope/level of executive engagement to the response options offered by the OBS, due in part to the generality of the question and uncertainty as to what constitutes \"the executive\" and what constitutes \"public engagement\". \n\nA response of \"b\" is considered to reasonably reflect the overall degree to which formal requirements exist for executive agencies (broadly defined, as discussed below) to engage with the public on budget formulation and execution.\n\nThe range of activities representing some form of \"engagement\" between executive agencies and the public can be viewed as quite extensive, depending on how broadly one defines the range of \"executive agencies\". \n\nOn the one hand, if the scope of \"the executive\" is limited to NZ Treasury as the central finance agency managing the process of budget preparation and financing of budget execution, then formal requirements to engage (directly) with the public are also relatively limited (to public hearings held by Parliament, as addressed in Q.126-Q.130).  While public submissions are evident in the case of legislative hearings on budget policy formulation, these may not really meet the expected standard of  an (interactive) consultative engagement process, but rather a conveyance of views from specific public interest groups into the (formal) hearing process under which the executive is under no obligation to accept or incorporate budget policy on the basis of views expressed by public submissions. \n\nExtending the scope of \"the executive\" to include individual central governments departments/ministries, the range and depth of mechanisms in place for public engagement increases. A limited survey/investigation of selected departments/ministries indicates that executive agencies do have relatively routine (and one could say, \"formal\") processes in place for public engagement, although these may be driven by what the departments/ministries deem to be \"good practices\" rather than by specific legal/regulatory requirements. \n\nAlso, with respect to the budget policy formulation process, it is important to note the role of \"green\" and \"white\" papers produced by (or under the authority of) executive departments/ministries for eventual submission to Cabinet for approval as policy and introduced to Parliament as a bill (if legislative changes are required). These policy papers produced by the executive are released with the intention to generate public comment and submissions. This is a process that can run over the course of years for major policy initiatives. One recent example is discussed below.\n\nA broader view of \"the executive\" could include Crown Entities, including \"decentralized\" units such as regional District Health Boards (or even individual schools). At this level, formal requirements for public engagement policy development and implementation can be more fully developed, being more direct and interactive on the basis of localized issues, decision-making and public access (e.g. to regular DHB meetings). \n\n1. Consultations with NZ Treasury (Simon Duncan) highlighted: (i) Treasury participation in public hearings of the FEC Select Committee in Parliament held over the course of each budget year/cycle (presentation of BPS, FSR, the Estimates, the Budget EFU and Half-Year EFU, year-end Financial Statements); and (ii) relatively recent, though not necessarily annual nor legally mandated, actions taken by Treasury to support engagement with stakeholders and with the public at large or particular population groups (e.g. students). Most examples of the latter outreach effort involving surveys, lecture/discussion series, public presentations, etc. were also cited in response to Q.66 related to efforts by the executive to identify informational needs for the Citizens Budget.  \n\n2. Consultations Parliament's Office of the Clerk (Peter Carr) also highlighted the hearings held by FEC, as well as many \"subject\" select committees covering specific sectors/policy areas, noting that: (i) these hearings are (generally, but not always) open to public attendance; (ii) involving reporting by executive officials that enters the public domain; and (iii) can, in some instances, involve evidence presented by the public (i.e. individuals or non-governmental organizations) either as written submissions or as testimony before a committee (or both).\n \n3. As previously noted (e.g. Q.104), , the law (PFA) and Parliamentary Standing Orders specify requirements for public Parliamentary hearings to consider evidence for a broad range of budget-related documentation at both the formulation stage and throughout the budget execution phases (mid-year and year-end reports). Again, as noted above, the scope of such hearings includes both consolidated government finances as well as budget policies and finances for specific departments/ministries or votes. \n\n4. A review of reporting from FEC and a sample of other select committees examining budget issues indicates that extent of \"public engagement\" in hearings is generally limited to occasional public submissions of evidence, usually written, and even this appears to be limited to only relatively few hearings. \n\nNote: A more active public engagement may be evident in submissions for select committee hearings on specific policy issues, where executive officials are also likely to be involved.\n\n5. A review of Treasury documents and activities (also noted above) indicates a range of recent surveys and activities intended to support or broaden public engagement. Components of Treasury's recent efforts to consult with stakeholders, including media, academia, business community, and others in the general public to increase general awareness and participation in budget policy formulation and processes have included:\n\n(i) a series of seminars over period from August 2013 through June 2014 intended to broaden public awareness and discussion of key issues leading up preparation of the \"2014 Investment Statement: Managing the Crown's Balance Sheet\" looking at long-term fiscal issues and strategies;\n\n(ii) consultative processes in surrounding examination of Treasury's LT fiscal model and preparation of 2013 LT fiscal strategy paper \"Long-term Fiscal Projections: Reassessing Assumptions, Testing New Perspectives\"; and\n\n(iii) the Schools and University Challenges recently initiated to broaden participation and interest in budget policy issues and processes targeting students. These are open competitions with information provided on the Treasury website. The Challenges award quite substantial scholarships/prizes for the winning contributions to debate around policy priorities (\"advice to incoming Minister\") and policy analysis of selected issues. \n\n6. Reports produced by individual departments/ministries found through a search materials on public engagement indicate efforts by some executive agencies to put in place routine processes to support public engagement in either policy formulation or implementation. Examples cited above are for Transport and Health.\n\n7. A review of selected departmental/ministerial annual reports provides evidence of public engagement/consultations on policy development and/or service delivery, with forms of engagement focus group sessions with various stakeholders (e.g. \"clients\", interest groups, industry or \"experts\"), customer surveys, etc. \n\n8. A review of the role, management and information produced by regional District Health Boards (DHBs), with focus on avenues for public engagement through consultative processes and public meetings of these \"decentralized\" executive agencies.\n\n9. Public engagement occurs in the policy formulation process through the production and dissemination of \"green\" and \"white\" papers as a policy initiative develops from initial analysis and identification of issues through to formal Cabinet consideration and eventually to Parliamentary deliberation and vote. As noted above, this policy formulation process for significant budget policy initiatives can generate a considerable and substantive engagement between the executive and the public. One recent example is the Children's Action Plan, which began with the development and release of a \"green\" paper by the Ministry of Social Development in 2011, followed by a consultative process involving, among other things, receipt and review of over 9,000 submissions from the public. That was followed by development of a \"white\" paper for Cabinet approval in 2012. Ultimately, the policy agreed by Cabinet and a bill submitted to Parliament in 2013 to address the necessary legislative changes. That legislative process included additional consideration of public submissions with passage of the Vulnerable Children Act See: Revised Source Citation:\nIn response to guidance from OBS/IBP staff, the scope of applicable evidence of public consultative engagement on the part of the executive is narrower than that originally cited, with the exclusion of parliamentary processes (e.g. select committee hearings and written submissions on policy proposals - items 3,4 and 9 cited below) and exclusion of public engagement via regional District Health Boards (item 8 cited below).  \n\nOn the basis of further review and assessment of the scope of public engagement, the extent of legal mandates for such consultative processes and the absence of a clear/comprehensive legal mandate specific to the central finance agency (i.e. Treasury) responsible for overall budget formulation and implementation, the most appropriate response is assessed as being \"c\".\n\n\nOriginal Source Citation:\nOn the basis of a \"broad\" view of \"the executive\" and \"public engagement\", it is arguable that formal mechanisms do exist for both public engagement at both the formulation and execution stages of the budget process. Rather than aligning strictly with the text of the chosen OBS response option, the assessed \"score\" of \"b\" is more a (subjective) overall assessment of the depth and effectiveness of mechanisms across the wide variety identified below.\n\nSources include: \n\n1.

The New Zealand government recently accepted an invitation to join the Open Government Partnership. As a first step for under whole-of-government initiative with potential implications for deepening and broadening the scope for public engagement across a wide range of government activities, the government is in the process of developing the National Action Plan. That is scheduled to be submitted to the OGP on 31 July 2014. Following publication of the NAP, the next steps will be receive feedback on the NAP and to collaborate with civil society to develop an Implementation Plan outlining how each commitment will be delivered and the criteria for self-assessment. the government is then expected to work with civil society to monitor and evaluate progress on an ongoing basis. At this stage, it is too early to cite specific examples of how participation in the OGP will directly impact public engagement in budget formulation and execution.See:", "letter": "c"}, "114": {"score": "100.0", "comments": "Financial Reviews conducted by select committees of Parliament include review of audit reports for individual entities prepared by OAG and with select committees receiving advice from OAG as part of the Parliamentary review process.

The response of \"a\" may be overly \"generous\" in that it does not fully reflect the absence of a clear and comprehensive framework endorsing and supporting a broad whole-of-government standard or practice for implementation of public consultations by executive agencies.   \n\nOriginal Comment:\nBased on consideration of the mechanisms cited for Question 120 (inclusive of both policy/budget formulation and policy/budget implementation, the overall assessment is that the scope of executive engagement with the public is less for policy/budget implementation than for policy/budget formulation.\n\nNZ Treasury and other departments/ministries do participate in public Parliamentary hearings in relation to budget execution, including of both mid-year reporting and year-end reporting in the case of Treasury, and for year-end annual reports for many individual departments/ministries. However, while not precluded, the scope/extent of actual public participation or engagement in these Parliamentary hearing processes is, as previously noted, quite limited, based on a review of actual select committee reports for recent years.\n\nThat said, the background information for the select committee public hearings is readily available to the public well in advance of the hearings themselves and of relatively high quality, and the purpose of the hearings is relatively clear.\n\nAs noted in response to preceding questions (and also cited in response for 2012 OBS), individual department/ministries also report engaging in public consultations of various forms as a way to assess and improve service delivery (program implementation). Consultations can include regional focus groups for specific programs, online surveys, or other mechanisms. In many cases, the conduct of stakeholder or client survey mechanisms are tied to performance indicators for specific outputs (e.g. percentage measurements of \"client satisfaction\"), as identified in both the vote-specific volumes of The Estimates and as reported on in departmental/ministerial annual reports. Quite a few ministries report using some form of public surveys and consultations (e.g. service providers, clients, other stakeholders). As cited in the item #7 in the \"Sources\" box for Q.120, these ministries include: Health; Education; Social Development; Business, Innovation and Employment; and Transport. \n\nFinally, again taking a broader view on the scope of \"the executive\", regular public hearings held by \"decentralized\" entities such as District Health Boards (or even schools) also offer significant opportunities for direct public engagement with budget execution, including members of the public speaking at regularly scheduled meetings. The quality and timing of information provided to the public appears reasonably sufficient for supporting informed engagement In a more localized context. See: Revised Source Citation:\nBased on guidance from OBS/IBP staff indicating that the scope of applicable evidence for executive agencies engaging in public consultative processes during budget execution should not include  parliamentary processes (e.g. hearings) or (possibly) the activities of regional agencies such as District Health Boards, the revised citation of sources or evidence for public consultative processes during budget execution wold focus on \"client surveys\" for selected central government agencies (e.g. Ministry of Social Development) and public consultations for implementation of particular infrastructural projects (e.g. Transit NZ for roading). \n\nFocusing on this narrower scope of executive agency engagement in public consultative processes during budget implementation - defined to include a range of established routines involving either \"client surveys\", \"focus groups\" and consultations with affected public (as in the case of Transit NZ), although the scope of these public engagement processes may be narrow and, in some cases, lacking a mandatory basis in law, the articulation of objectives and provision of information within the context of these particular public engagement processes would appear to be reasonably good. With the focus being solely on the articulation of objectives and quality of information within the relatively limited range of agencies conducting such public consultations on specific policies/programs rather than the overall scope of public engagement across all executive agencies, the assessment is revised to an \"a\". \n\nNote: However, while the literal interpretation of criteria for an assessment of \"b\" do not necessarily apply, if there assessment were to also factor in the limited scope of public consultations conducted by executive agencies, then an assessment of \"b\" (or even \"c\") might be a better indicator of the strength or adequacy of the overall framework and implementation of consultative processes by executive agencies.    \n\n\nOriginal Source Citation:\nRefer to specific mechanisms and sources cited for Question 120.\n\nIn particular, focusing on the clearest direct engagement between \"the executive\" and \"the public\" in the phase of \"budget execution\" or policy implementation, attention is directed to:\n\n- Parliamentary hearings at which Treasury reports on budget implementation;\n- Parliamentary hearings focusing on performance (both financial review and service delivery) for specific departments/ministries\n- Departmental/ministerial engagement with the public on specific matters of service delivery\n- Routine public meetings of \"decentralized\" executive agencies (e.g DHBs)", "letter": "a"}, "123": {"score": "67.0", "comments": "See comments for Question 120 and Question 121.

Probably the clearest and relatively more substantive examples of this would be: (i) public documentation of how (some) public submissions on the \"green\" paper for the Children's Acton Plan influenced specific decisions taken by the executive on the final version presented to Parliament for approval; and (ii) information contained within departmental/ministerial reports indicating how the results of focus groups, client surveys and other forms of consultation have been used to adjust either policies or service delivery.
